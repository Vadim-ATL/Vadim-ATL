    Supervisor: Professor Almas Shintemirov, field: deep learning and computer vision applications in robot arm UR-5:
  - Developed a CNN model for controlling a robot arm in 3D space (6 DoF joints manipulation).
  - Integrated an IBVS (image-based visual servoing) optimization algorithm, reducing pose error to 10.2mm
    (translation) and 2.1° (rotation) in a multi-input/multi-output setup.
  - Implemented a feedback control system that reduced movement lag and tilt in the robot arm.

### Research Projects: November, 2024 - Present
- Custom Large language model (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and custom model de-
velopment for text summarization:
- Modified sentiment analysis model DistilBERT to Seq2Seq model with a decoder for abstractive text summarization, opti-
mizing for coherence of summaries, achieved ROUGE-L-mid score of 21.3.
- Designed LLM-powered RAG system for efficient retrieval of information from a ChromaDB
vector database and contextual response generation.
