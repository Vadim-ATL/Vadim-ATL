### Research Assistant | July 2022 - May 2023
- [ALARIS Lab](https://www.alaris.kz/), School of Engineering and Digital Sciences, NU Astana, Kazakhstan
    Supervisor: Professor Almas Shintemirov, field: deep learning and computer vision applications in robot arm UR-5:
  - Developed a CNN model for controlling a robot arm in 3D space (6 DoF joints manipulation).
  - Integrated an IBVS (image-based visual servoing) optimization algorithm, reducing pose error to 10.2mm
    (translation) and 2.1° (rotation) in a multi-input/multi-output setup.
  - Implemented a feedback control system that reduced movement lag and tilt in the robot arm.
