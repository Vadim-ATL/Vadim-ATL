# Hi there, I'm Vadim Atlassov!

## About Me
I am a deep learning researcher with 1.5 years of experience in deep learning and computer vision applications in object detection. 

I am passionate about developing deep learning  applications (object detection and segmentation) for the biological/medical imaging domain.

## Interests
My academic interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and medical applications. I am particularly fascinated by the SAM application of segmentation models.

## Future Goals
I actively seek opportunities to further my academic journey to a PhD program in deep learning and computer vision. I am enthusiastic about contributing to cutting-edge research and advancing the state-of-the-art in these fields.
